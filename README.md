"Automating Server Health Monitoring and Alerts with Python: A Step-by-Step Guide"

Imagine you're the guardian of a server, tasked with ensuring that everything runs smoothly. This server handles important applications, processes, and tasks for your company, and your job is to keep an eye on its health. Now, let’s make your job easier by setting up an automated system that checks the server’s health and sends you an alert if something goes wrong. This is where your Server Health Monitoring and Alerting System comes into play.

The Beginning: Setting Up the System
You start by installing Python and some useful libraries. These libraries will give you the tools you need to monitor the server’s health. First, you grab psutil, which helps you track the server’s CPU, memory, and disk usage. Then, you get smtplib, which is your messenger that sends email alerts. Finally, you have logging to keep a record of everything that happens.

Once these libraries are installed, you start writing the Python script that will monitor the server. This script will keep track of the CPU, memory, and disk usage of the server, checking them every few minutes.

Step 1: Keep a Watchful Eye on the Server
The first step in the script is to gather the server’s health data. You want to know how much of the server's resources are being used. For this, you use psutil, which gives you the current percentage of CPU and memory usage. With these numbers, you’ll know if things are getting a little too hot for comfort.

Every few minutes, your script will check the server's health stats. Think of it like you’re taking the server’s pulse every 5 minutes.

Step 2: Set the Alarm Bells for Critical Issues
Now that you know how to check the server’s health, it's time to set some thresholds—limits that, if crossed, will indicate something’s wrong. For example:

If the CPU usage goes above 80%, that’s a warning sign that the server is being overworked.

If the memory usage goes above 75%, it means the server is running out of resources and needs attention.

Your script will constantly keep an eye on these numbers. If anything crosses the line, it knows something’s wrong and needs immediate attention.

Step 3: Sending an Alert
So, let’s say the server’s CPU usage suddenly spikes to 85%, and you realize it's a problem. This is when your alert system kicks in. The script will log the event, recording that the CPU is high. But that’s not enough. You need to know about it right away, so the script sends you an email. It’ll use smtplib to send an email directly to your inbox, telling you:

What’s wrong (e.g., CPU usage is high)

How bad the issue is (e.g., 85% CPU usage)

The script also logs whether the alert was successfully sent or not, so you have a record of the incident.

Step 4: Continuous Monitoring and Repeat
The system doesn’t just stop after sending an email. It goes back to monitoring again after a short break (like 5 minutes). It keeps checking, keeps logging, and keeps sending alerts when necessary. It’s like having a personal assistant who checks the server’s health for you every few minutes and only interrupts you when something serious happens.

Step 5: Stopping the System
The monitoring system is designed to run forever until you decide to stop it manually. It keeps checking the system’s health 24/7, so you can focus on other important tasks, knowing that the server is being watched. When you finally decide to stop the system, you just end the script, and the monitoring halts.

Bonus Features to Make Your Job Easier
As you gain confidence in monitoring your server, you start adding more flexibility to the system. Instead of hardcoding values like the 80% CPU threshold, you make them adjustable so you can change them later without rewriting the script. You also add the ability to monitor disk usage and maybe even network activity, making the system more comprehensive.

As your project evolves, you think of integrating it with powerful monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for advanced visualizations. The system could also send alerts through Slack or Telegram for faster notifications. You’ve created a dynamic system that can grow with your needs.

Testing Your System
Before you let your system work full-time, you need to test it. You simulate high CPU and memory usage using stress-testing tools. When the thresholds are crossed, the system sends you an email, and you check the logs to make sure everything works as expected.

Conclusion: Empowering the Guardian
By setting up this health monitoring system, you’ve made your job as the server’s guardian much easier. Instead of constantly checking the server yourself, you’ve built an automated system that monitors the server, logs the data, and sends you alerts when something goes wrong. This system is not only practical for personal use but also scalable enough to be used in production environments where server uptime and performance are critical. As you continue to improve the system, it becomes an even more valuable tool in your DevOps toolkit, ensuring your servers remain healthy and alert at all times.

This project has not only enhanced your Python skills but has also given you hands-on experience with system monitoring, email notifications, and automation—skills that are highly valued in the world of DevOps.

# Server Health Monitoring and Alerting System

## Overview
This project automates the process of monitoring server health (CPU, memory, and disk usage) and sends email alerts if the usage exceeds certain thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%, Memory > 75%). It uses Python and several libraries to gather system stats and send notifications via email.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `psutil` (for system health monitoring)
  - `smtplib` (for sending emails)
  - `logging` (for event logging)
- A Gmail or SMTP-compatible email account to send alerts (you may need to enable access for less secure apps or use an app-specific password for Gmail).

## Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install psutil
